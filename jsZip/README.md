This js-compressor is base on [YUI Compressor for .NET](https://github.com/PureKrome/YUICompressor.NET "YUICompressor.NET").  

[Original author](http://www.cnblogs.com/zjfree/archive/2010/10/19/1855687.html) designed a winform GUI for it.  
I just did some modification based on the original version.
